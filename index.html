            <p>Steven Paul Jobs (/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate,
                industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO),
                and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt
                Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and
                CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
                1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

                Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco
                Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through
                India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI report states that
                he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one of
                the two or three most important things" he had done in his life.

                Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo
                gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
                microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and
                had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
                1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The
                Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter,
                the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long
                power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few
                of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in
                computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual
                effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The
                new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated film Toy Story (1995).

                Apple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was
                largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked
                closely with designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications,
                beginning in 1997 with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes,
                iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was
                replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern
                Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in
                2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011</p>

            <p>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American media magnate, internet
                entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its chairman,
                chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder.[3][4] He also is a co-founder of the solar sail
                spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot and serves as one of its board members.[5]

                Born in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched the Facebook
                social networking service from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo
                Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[6] Originally launched to select college
                campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012.
                Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His net worth is estimated to be
                nearly $54 billion as of March 2020.[7] In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made
                billionaire. As of 2019, he is the only person under 50 in the Forbes ten richest people list, and the
                only one under 40 in the Top 20 Billionaires list.[8]

                Since 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in
                the world as a part of its Person of the Year award.[9][10][11] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked
                10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.[12]</p>
